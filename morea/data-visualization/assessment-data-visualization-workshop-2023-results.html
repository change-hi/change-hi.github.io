<h2 id="participant-assessment-comments">Participant Assessment Comments</h2>

<p><em>What is a situation in which a pie chart would be a poor approach to visualizing data? If you don’t recall, just write “I don’t recall”.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Almost anytime other than the comparison of 2, maybe 3 groups.</li>
  <li>Comparison of multiple categories across time.</li>
  <li>Multiple categories of data that don’t differ very much.</li>
  <li>When more than 2 items are being compared.</li>
  <li>When you have many categorical values which will clutter up the visualization by requireing many colors that the user is not able to understand.</li>
  <li>It is poor to visualize comparisons among more than three variables with a pie chart or minor differences between categories.</li>
  <li>Pretty much every situation XD (but especially those when you need to compare between/among the elements in the chart)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>When might you prefer to use Plot.ly over Tableau?  If you don’t recall, just write “I don’t recall”.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>When creating quick and dirty visualizations in code.</li>
  <li>Plot.ly is open source and it has interactive visualizations (dash)</li>
  <li>For coding in Python and generating a dynamic plot that I may want to post online (with JavaScript, etc.), I’d use Plot.ly. Tableau is more plug-and-play: little-to-no coding.</li>
  <li>When you working with multiple coding languages.</li>
  <li>I prefer to use plotly over Tableau so that I have more control over my data and what I want to visualize for a final presentation.</li>
  <li>Plot.ly can be implemented in programming situations and free to use versus Tableau.</li>
  <li>When integrating with other platform code (Python or Javascript)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Has this workshop material caused you to consider making changes to the way you visualize data in your own research and/or practice? If so, please briefly describe what changes you might make. If not, just write “No changes at the moment.”</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, I will start exploring Tableau</li>
  <li>I am interested to see how I can use Tableau to connect to my database and create visualizations</li>
  <li>Yes, I will explore Plotly in greater depth as a possible substitute for my existing web plotting tools (Dygraphs, flot, and Google Charts). Tableau was fascinating for ease-of-use, but not sure how I can apply to the web.</li>
  <li>Yes</li>
  <li>Yes, I learned about using a new visualization tool called Tableau. This seems like it would make visualizations very quickly just to understand my data.</li>
  <li>Yes, I have never used plot.ly for programming visualizations, only matplotlib or ggplot, but it seems like a great library. It’s also always good to get a refresher on the do’s and don’ts of data visualization and learn what tools are out there to make the best, readable graphs for your data.</li>
  <li>Considering more dashboarding options with Plotly and Dash</li>
</ul>

<p><em>In general, did you find the CONTENT of this workshop to be useful?  If so, please briefly summarize up to three skills you acquired (or started to acquire) as a result of this workshop.  If not, please write “Content not useful.”</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, the general tips for better visualizations were very useful.</li>
  <li>Yes</li>
  <li>Yes, thanks. Liked the background discussion, particularly about color.</li>
  <li>Yes. It made me more aware of components that constitute good graphics.</li>
  <li>Yes, the content was useful. The skills I learned was how to make a better table, how to feel uneasy when looking at visualizations that aren’t good, and how to build a better intuition on making better interface designs.</li>
  <li>The content in this workshop is useful, I learned about new resources and libraries to create data visualizations.</li>
  <li>Chart type selection resources; Tableau builder interface; SAGE jupyter integrations</li>
</ul>

<p><em>In general, did you find the PEDAGOGY (i.e. method of teaching) of this workshop to be appropriate?  If so, please briefly summarize one or two teaching methods you found to be useful. If not, please write “Pedagogy was not appropriate.”</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, it was engaging and using current tools is always nice.</li>
  <li>yes, the walk through with Tableau using test data helped.</li>
  <li>Yes, it was good. Stepping through examples online and the tutorial visuals were all helpful.</li>
  <li>Yes.</li>
  <li>Yes. Having the mentor lecture first and talk about the concepts was much easier to understand. When working through examples, I think having the student as a facilitator working through a problem makes the most sense.</li>
  <li>I did like the pedagogy for this workshop. I like the sort of lecture/introduction into the topics and tools for the first half and then getting to play with the tools in the second half with an example dataset.</li>
  <li>Appreciate casual presentation style, “everything is a surface” visuals using pan and zoom to navigate web sites and screen-shared content</li>
</ul>

<p><em>No workshop is perfect. What are one or two things you would suggest we change to improve this workshop in future?  If you can’t think of anything, then write “You’re wrong. This workshop was perfect.”</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>You’re wrong. This workshop was perfect. (2x)</li>
  <li>Maybe introduce a better library than plotly</li>
  <li>Maybe include some test data to run through the Plot.ly demo as well. Slow down a bit?</li>
  <li>Just right for the short amount of time available. Might have appreciated stepping through a dataset and more involved example in Plotly, but understand the time constraints.</li>
  <li>I think working through a concrete example where we show off our visualizations with the rest of the class/team would have been fun.</li>
  <li>There are so many different topics you can cover in data visualization, but this workshop did a good job of provide new and useful tools and information.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Did this workshop result in any new potential collaborations (i.e. people who you might contact in future to discuss research and/or professional issues)?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>5 responses: No the workshop did not result in any new potential collaborations</li>
  <li>1 responses: I am not sure if the workshop resulted in any new potential collaborations</li>
  <li>1 responses: Yes, the workshop resulted in a new potential collaboration</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If the workshops resulted in any new potential collaborations, are any of them with people outside your “home” discipline (i.e. your department)?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>4 responses: No.</li>
  <li>2 responses: I don’t know</li>
  <li>1 response: Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Do you have any ideas for new workshops that would help you with your research and professional development? If so, please briefly describe. If not, please write (“No ideas at the moment.”)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Perhaps a follow-up course on tableau</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructor-assessment-comments">Instructor Assessment Comments</h2>

<p><em>For your workshop, how would you rate the overall “success” of the workshop (i.e. your subjective sense of things like student engagement, questions, discussion, completion of activities, etc.)?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 response: About as successful as expected.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What aspects of your workshop did not work as well as possible, and what are your thoughts on how to improve them in future?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s hard for a long talk of 1 hour to hold the attention of the mass without any humor in between. As we tend to present with the Morea template, it’s hard to create humor.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What aspects of your workshop do you feel worked well (so that we know to encourage their use in future workshops when appropriate)?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I think colorful graphs and less use of code worked well for my workshop.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Is there anything else you would like us to know about your workshop? Are there ways we can better support your instruction in future?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>I personally think Powerpoint presentations are better as you can control the information and humor in a balanced way.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Do you have ideas for new workshops (don’t worry, we’ll find someone else to lead them!) If so, please jot down your idea here. If not, write “Nothing at the moment”.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Different deep learning architectures can have different workshops.</li>
  <li>Different AI fields (comp vision/NLP/Audio/Sensor) can have different workshops on their own as data processing and model designs are soooo different for all of them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="discussion-and-recommendations">Discussion and recommendations</h2>

<p>The initial questions assess several of the learning outcomes.  The responses provide evidence that the learning outcomes assessed were, in general, achieved. Participant feedback seems to indicate that the pacing and content of this workshop was appropriate.</p>

<p>Recommendations for next time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Try to increase the time spent on “activities” to reduce the time spent “listening”. For example, in the first section, show several problematic visualizations and have participants split up into small groups to “debug” them, then present their results. If you retain Plotly as an example tool, provide test data to allow participants to actively try out the tool.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think about ways to change the in-class interaction so that more collaborative connections between folks in different disciplines occurs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
