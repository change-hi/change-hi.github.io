## Welcome to Change-HI/EDU

You have reached the home page for the educational resources associated with the [University of Hawaii EPSCOR Change-HI Program](https://hawaii.edu/epscor/).  Change-HI/EDU is intended to serve as a "one stop shop" for cross-institutional, formal and informal data science educational resources.  Currently, this site supports various programs associated with the [Hawaii Data Science Institute](https://datascience.hawaii.edu/), including CI-TRACS, CITRUS, and the Data Fellows program.

Some modules are designed to be used as curriculum for one day workshops, while others can be used asynchronously (i.e. the student can work through the material at their own pace and time).

## About this site

Modules have one or more of the following components:

  * [Prerequisites](/prerequisites), describing skills you should acquire in order to be ready for the module.
  * [Learning outcomes](/outcomes), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](/readings), providing background or reference material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](/experiences), providing a structured set of exercises enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](/assessments), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material and to provide feedback about the module.
