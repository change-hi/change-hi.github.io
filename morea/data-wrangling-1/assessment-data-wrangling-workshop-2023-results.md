# Data Wrangling Workshop 2023 Assessment Results

## Participant Assessment Comments

*Why do you use Series and DataFrames to hold data in Jupyter Notebooks (as opposed to native Python data structures)?  If you don't recall, just write "I don't recall".*

* It is a convenient method of storage that is easily readable and allows for convenient computations/cleaning.
* Jupyter Notebooks allow you to look at larger datasets and you can choose different coding languages.
* Series and DataFrames are ways to help describe datasets in terms of rows, columns, and table labels, very similar to Excel sheets, that are useful for data wrangling and analysis. Intuitive way to describe datasets.

*Let's say you're looking at an unfamiliar DataFrame, and you want to know the types of values associated with it. How might you find that out?  If you don't recall, just write "I don't recall".* 

* You could read your data in as a dataframe then use df.dtypes.
* Is it the datatypes command .dtype? I donʻt recall
* You can get to know the attributes of a DataFrame by attaching these commands to the dataframe: .shape, .size, .dtypes, .columns

*Has this workshop material caused you to consider making changes to the way you wrangle data in your own research and/or practice? If so, please briefly describe what changes you might make. If not, just write "No changes at the moment."*

* No changes at the moment.
* Definitely! I've only really done data wrangling tasks in R, so it was good to learn how to do this in Python with Pandas.

*In general, did you find the CONTENT of this workshop to be useful?  If so, please briefly summarize up to three skills you acquired (or started to acquire) as a result of this workshop.  If not, please write "Content not useful."*

* The content of the workshop was useful for general data wrangling. Specifically, exploration of the diverse functionalities of pandas.
* Yes. The workshop was well structured with clear learning outcomes and goals. I learned a little about Pandas data types and how to load a limited number of rows and subset data.
* Yes, I thought the content from this workshop was very useful! I learned how to summarize data, filter data, and deal with missing data.

*In general, did you find the PEDAGOGY (i.e. method of teaching) of this workshop to be appropriate?  If so, please briefly summarize one or two teaching methods you found to be useful. If not, please write "Pedagogy was not appropriate."*

* The workshop exercises and examples were great at reinforcing the materials covered.
* Yes, the workshop was paced well with regular check-ins and opportunities to ask questions. I attended in person and found it helpful that the instructors went around the room helping users to import the example dataset. The practice questions/ quizzes were helpful.
* I thought the pedagogy of this workshop was appropriate. I needed some background/lecture slides to get an explanation of what Pandas is and all the data wrangling features to use, so doing a small task at the end of each chapter was helpful to solidify/practice what we just learned.

*No workshop is perfect. What are one or two things you would suggest we change to improve this workshop in future?  If you can't think of anything, then write "You're wrong. This workshop was perfect."*

* It would have been nice to have a little more time to work on the final exercise.
* The workshop was well paced and interesting. Perhaps a follow-up workshop/ deeper dive could be an option.
* All good things! This was a good introduction to pandas and I'd like to learn more about how to use this tool.


*Did this workshop result in any new potential collaborations (i.e. people who you might contact in future to discuss research and/or professional issues)?*

* 2 responses: No the workshop did not result in any new potential collaborations
* 1 responses: I am not sure if the workshop resulted in any new potential collaborations

*If the workshops resulted in any new potential collaborations, are any of them with people outside your "home" discipline (i.e. your department)?*

* 2 responses: No.
* 1 responses: I don't know

*Do you have any ideas for new workshops that would help you with your research and professional development? If so, please briefly describe. If not, please write ("No ideas at the moment.")*

* Tableau
* Python
* R

## Instructor Assessment Comments

*For your workshop, how would you rate the overall "success" of the workshop (i.e. your subjective sense of things like student engagement, questions, discussion, completion of activities, etc.)?*

* 1 response: About as successful as expected.
* 1 response: More successful than expected.



*What aspects of your workshop did not work as well as possible, and what are your thoughts on how to improve them in future?*

* There wasn't enough time to present the material. Workshops and data wrangling could benefit from more time rather than cutting down the material to fit the 2-hour time slot, perhaps we should consider a flipped or a longer data wrangling workshop (4 hours).
* It was difficult to provide the needed attention to help the online audience during such a short, yet loaded workshop with people both online and in person. Can it be restricted to in-person, or could 1 more Fellow be added to technical workshops with a commitment to only assist on the day of the workshop) A flipped workshop would also solve this problem.
* We really wanted to make use of SAGE3 to turn exercises into collaborative activities to further audience engagement. In the future I think group work in general could be helpful to workshops.

*What aspects of your workshop do you feel worked well (so that we know to encourage their use in future workshops when appropriate)?*

* Small bite-sized modules (~20 minutes each) followed by exercises. The modules I am used to are usually one hour long. Short modules worked surprisingly well.
* I think that the topic of Data Wrangling is inherently something students want to learn about today. These sorts of topics may be more crowd pleasing than others. Especially considering that we are a series of Data Science workshops, showcasing these practical skills draw a bigger audience.

*Is there anything else you would like us to know about your workshop? Are there ways we can better support your instruction in future?*

* Transform technical workshops on topics a Fellow is expected to be familiar with into a flipped classroom model. We can record the material online and provide the students with the opportunity to practice in the classroom.
* To give students an opportunity to practice all year, consider doing technical workshops early in the year (such as in September).
* I think that 2 hours is a short time to be introducing data wrangling. Perhaps it can be a two part workshop. One week being introductory and the next week being advanced. The advanced work might be more appealing to Data Science fellows.

*Do you have ideas for new workshops (don't worry, we'll find someone else to lead them!) If so, please jot down your idea here. If not, write "Nothing at the moment".*

* Natural language processing and Language models
* Foundational Statistics in Data Science (maybe some modeling)
* Software development for data analysts
* Data Wrangling (same workshop) but in R instead of Python
* Time series data analysis
* Databases and data standards
* An advanced follow-up workshop to data wrangling.

## Discussion and recommendations

The initial questions assess several of the learning outcomes.  The responses provide evidence that the learning outcomes assessed were, in general, achieved. Participant feedback seems to indicate that the pacing of this workshop was reasonable, although both participants and instructors would like to see a longer workshop. 

The idea of "flipping" the pedagogical model is an intriguing one, but somewhat problematic in the context of the Data Fellows program, because we cannot, in general, expect participants to spend a significant amount of time working on the material outside of the workshop hours. 

Recommendations for next time:

1. Create a two part workshop, "Data Wrangling, Part 1" and "Data Wrangling, Part 2". 

2. Think about ways to change the in-class interaction so that more collaborative connections between folks in different disciplines occurs.
