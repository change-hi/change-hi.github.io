## Preparation 

Here are the things you need to do to be prepared for this workshop.

### Have command line experience

We recommend you go through the [Software Carpentry shell-novice tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) if you are new to the command-line.  But, if you attended last week's workshop, you should be good to go with the command line!

### Setup a Jupyter IDE

You can run Jupyter on Google Colab, your own machine, on the UH Mana HPC cluster. 

#### Google Colab

[Google Colab]() provides a free cloud instance. You must sign in with a Google account. To use your hawaii.edu account, you must [enable Google@UH Consumer Apps](https://www.hawaii.edu/google/extra/index.php) 

#### Local

Alternatively, you run code on your local machine. First install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Then install the new [Jupyterlab desktop application](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop#installation). 

#### Mana HPC Cluster

If you have a [Mana](https://mana.its.hawaii.edu/) HPC account, you can run a JupyterLab through Open OnDemand.
