<p>In 2016, a team led by the San Diego Supercomputing Center was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to establish an institute to accelerate the development of scientific gateways which address the needs of researchers across NSF’s directorates. This institute bacame the Scientific Gateways Community Institute, SGCI.</p>

<p>Organizations like Scientific Gateways Community Institute provide great resources to help when building a scientific gateway. Their goal is to facilitate the sharing of experiences, technologies, and practices of those working with science gateways. SGCI hosts workshops on developing, operating and sustaining gateways as well as provides a science gateway catalog giving users a means to discover gateways within different disciplines. Furthermore, SGCI provides regular tech summits to help developers find solutions to common gateway-related issues.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <p><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info fa-xl"></i> <strong>Note: SGCI Offerings</strong></p>
