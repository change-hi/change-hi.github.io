## Modus Operandi

Psychologist Donald MacKinnon, Ph.D. and comedian John Cleese of Monty Python claim that **creativity is not a talent**, but rather, **a way of operating**.

They believe that creative people put themselves in a **mood**, allowing their **natural creativity to flow**. In this state, individuals can **play** and **be childlike**, opening themselves up to **exploration and discovery**, without a goal in mind.

**Play for its own sake is the key.**

They mention **two modes** in which people conduct work: closed mode and open mode. In **closed mode**, we **focus** on **structured, purpose-driven** tasks with less room for creative thought. In **open mode** we **relax** into a **state of awareness** with less purpose, more curiosity, and a higher capacity for playfulness. We **shed any pressure** to perform in a certain way and allow our **natural creativity** to surface.

<hr/>
1. **Space**: You cannnot be creative in your "work" environment. You need a dedicated space to get away from closed mode. This forms the first part of the Space/Time Oasis.
2. **Time**: Creative time must be scheduled (90 minutes) with a specific start time and end time. Otherwise, it is too easy to drift back to work mode. This forms the second part of the Space/Time Oasis.
3. **Deferring Decisions**: More creative people are willing to tolerate the discomfort of not solving a problem quickly so that they may discover a much better and more original solution.
4. **Confidence**: You need confidence to be free to play.  You need to be open to trying anything without fear of it not working.
5. **Humor**: Humor gets us from closed mode to open mode faster than anything else. Laughter creates relaxation & humor widens our perspective.

</div>

When the creative "work" is done and we **wish to implement** our creative decisions, remaining in **creative mode can become counterproductive**. Closed mode becomes more beneficial and we wish to **activate the Executive Attention Network**.

Building the **capacity to switch** between open and closed modes when desired is **key**.
