# 3. Collaboration and Creativity

<div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-globe fa-xl"></i> **Overview**
<hr/>

**Key Points**
  * Most creative ideas develop over time with influence from our environment.
  * Cultivating genuine connections with others helps build a richer human experience and thus creative capacity.
  * Researchers need extra time to digest the large amount of information out there and work across disciplines to make major scientific breakthroughs.

**Objectives**
  * Recognize factors in our environment that may influence our creativity for both the positive and negative.
  * Gain a deeper appreciation of genuine connections in our professional and personal lives.
  * Understand the factors involved in major scientific breakthroughs and the methods for increasing their liklihood.

## Eureka...?

We often hear about "Eureka moments."

One of the **earliest Eureka moments** involves Archimedes in Ancient Greece. One day, **Archimedes sat down in a public bath and noticed the water rise**. He proceeded to shout "Eureka" in response to his **new revelation connecting volume and displacement**. This story supposedly provides the **origin of the name eureka can**, a scientific instrument for measuring volume.

## A Slow Burn

{% include youtube.html id="NugRZGDbPFU" %}

Popular science author and media theorist Steven Johnson notes in his book "Where Good Ideas Come From" that **Eureka moments are largely mythical**. Instead, **good ideas** develop over **long gestation periods** and derive from **random collisions with many ideas** with **influences from lots of other people** over long periods of time.

## Connections are Key

{% include youtube.html id="7ZTPgJYj3pM" %}

Professor of Sociology and Strategy at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business believes that the **diversity of an individual's connections** largely explains **career success**. Individuals with **small, closed networks** where the people all know each another are **less likely to perform well** in terms of compensation, evaluation, promotion, etc. Those with **large, open networks** with people in different communities **perform much better** with regard to these metrics.

## Exponential Expansion

In January 2023, researchers noted a **marked decline in disruptive science and technology** over time. They attribute this trend in part to scientists’ and inventors’ **reliance on a narrower set of existing knowledge**.

Scholars may **struggle to keep up with the research literature** due to its exponential growth, especially if it **spans multiple disciplines**. To **combat this**, the authors reccommend that scholars **read widely and give themselves time** to keep up with the rapidly expanding knowledge frontier.

## Poincare's Beach

Henri Poincare once made a **breakthrough discovery while on vacation** in the sea-side French town of Countances. Check out the story in this article on [mathematical discovery](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/thinking-time-new-maths-theories-come-from-random-moments-1.4795727).
