# 1. What Does Science Say About Creativity?

<div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-globe fa-xl"></i> **Overview**
<hr/>

**Key Points**
  * Creativity invloves three main cognitive processes.
  * There are both genetic and, much more importantly, environmental factors that affect creativity.
  * We can become more creative with the right conditions, methods, and practice.

**Objectives**
  * Understand some of the basic neuroscience of creativity.
  * Challenge the incorrect notion that creativity is innate.
  * Get our creative juices flowing.

## How Does the Creative Brain Work?

Creativity draws on **three main brain networks**:[^1][^2]

[^1]: Jung, R. E., Mead, B. S., Carrasco, J., & Flores, R. A. (2013). [The structure of creative cognition in the human brain](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00330), Frontiers in human neuroscience, 7.

* **Executive Attention Network** for targeted attention and focus.
* **Imagination Network / Default Mode Network** for mental simulation about future events.
* **Salience Network** for internal stream of consciousness, external stimuli.

Researchers found that **when all networks are active** it can actually **diminish creativity** and that **reducing executive attention** network a little can **boost creativity**.

**Focused attention** has been shown to **limit spontaneity.**

<i class="fa-solid fa-book fa-xl"></i> **What does the Research Say?**
<hr/>

A study of ADHD in children and adults showed that **people with ADHD** have **more active imagination networks** and **less active executive attention network** vs neurotypical individuals.[^3]

A functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study of **jazz musicians** found that when they were **improvising**, their **imagination networks were more active**. But when they just played over **learned musical sequence** their **executive attention network were more active**.[^4]

## Nature vs. Nurture

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="100%" file="morea/creative-thinking/fig/dog_in_suit.jpeg" alt="Dog in suit" caption="" %}

Researchers have identified **genetics factors** that **may influence creativity**, but there is also evidence that **creativity can be learned**.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-book fa-xl"></i> **What does the Research Say?**
<hr/>
Researchers found that people who were **more creative in music** had an **extra copy of the Glucose Mutarotase (GALM) Gene**. This gene is involved in the release of Serotonin (neurotransmitter that promotes neural connections). **GALM increases production of serotonin and the brain’s ability to use it**.[^5]

One study **compared professional dancers, artists, and musicians with novices** in their fields. During mental or active improvisational sessions (compose a 5 note tune, mentally compose a drawing, mentally perform a dance), the **professionals thought about the task differently, engaging different parts of their brain** as compared to novices.[^6]

## Becoming More Creative

Based on current research and our intuition, we want to
* Activate our brain networks in a non-competing way.
* Treat creativity like a skill.

With this mindset, we can cultivate creativity by creating the right **conditions** and employing the right **mechanics**.
