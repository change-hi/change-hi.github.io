Imagine you and your team have been tasked to design the exhibits for the Hawaiʻi Museum of Science and Stuff (HI-MOSS). Come up with ideas for what exhibits that you feel would be of greatest interest to Hawaiʻi's residents. 
1. Create your own board in SAGE3.
2. Write ideas for 10 minutes with 1 sticky note per idea.
3. After 10 minutes, copy your sticky notes into a communal board.
4. Explain your sticky notes to the group.
