# HPC Workshop 2022 Assessment Results

## Participant Assessment Comments

*In your own words, what is the performance difference between CPUs and GPUs for deep learning? (If you don't remember, just write "I don't remember.)"*

* GPUs are better at doing parallel taks
* GPUs are much faster due to their ability to parallelize
* GPUs typically have better performance but are more expensive than CPUs.
* CPUs are slower than GPUs
* GPUs - better performance
* GPUs are much faster due to parallelization
* GPU has a faster processing time compared to CPU
* GPUs are faster at AI/ML model construction than CPUs
* GPUs allow the parallel computations leading to the faster computations for deep learning.

*In your own words, when is it better to use lus_scratch rather /home/user? (If you don't remember, just write "I don't remember").* 

* larger data set, faster writing
* Whenever you want better performance
* lus_scratch will typically allow for faster file transfers and modeling
* When writing files, it is better to write to lus_Scratch moreso than /home/user directory
* I don't remember
* lus_scratch is better for read/write performance (especially write), less good for data reliability
* When you have a large quantity of data, lus_scratch processes this faster than /home/user
* store temporary data that is needed/generated while running an experiment
* Under C folder to easy to search

*In general, did you find the CONTENT of this workshop to be useful?  If so, please briefly summarize up to three skills you acquired (or started to acquire) as a result of this workshop.  If not, please write "Content not useful."*

* Yes. Setting up environment, rough sense of machine learning,
* Yes, navigating the MANA tools and learning to install packages, create environments were all helpful.
* The content of the workshop was useful. Skills acquired include: downloading packages on MANA, running Jupyter Labs through MANA, and understanding the different file types available for use (and the associated pros and cons.)
* This workshop was useful because it felt like a review on how to use Mana. Now I have a resource that I can use whenever do I decide to us Mana.
* yes - useful for machine learning
* Yes. I'd done the Mana introduction workshop before, but wasn't sure how to connect that fully to actually running models; this closed that gap completely.
* Yes, very helpful
* Yes. The workshop was useful. (1) - Connecting to mana; (2) - Using Jupyter Lab; (3) - The difference between the file systems
* I have a much better understanding of HPC with some application examples.

*In general, did you find the PEDAGOGY (i.e. method of teaching) of this workshop to be appropriate?  If so, please briefly summarize one or two teaching methods you found to be useful. If not, please write "Pedagogy was not appropriate."*

* Hands on experience
* Yes, easy to follow exercises!
* The pedagogy was appropriate. This workshop took a very interactive approach which was useful in understanding the necessary steps to take in using MANA. I appreciated that all of the necessary scripts were provided in the notebook so participants didn't have to try to replicate these or copy and paste from the modules.
* It was good until we got into the notebooks. I think we can run it on our own time at home but it was good to talk through it. Perhaps we could have gone through them quicker.
* yes
* Yes. Pacing was mostly good. Format was mostly engaging.
* Yes, this workshop was very well structured. The overview and objectives of each module were clearly defined. The presenter and instructor had an excellent grasp of the material. The workshop was well organized with regular opportunities for participants to ask questions.
* The step-by-step guide was useful in understanding how to use mana
* I like it!

*No workshop is perfect. What are one or two things you would suggest we change to improve this workshop in future?  If you can't think of anything, then write "You're wrong. This workshop was perfect."*

* More interactions and writing codes instead of copy & paste
* The discussion section felt unnecessary.
* You're wrong. This workshop was perfect.
* Allow us to work together in groups to make our own notebook. Challenge our understanding on using Mana.
* none
* Maybe a little rushed at times, but not too bad since I was able to catch up. Also, with the pre-completed notebook, it didn't give us any opportunity to try the challenges ourselves.
* This workshop was perfect.
* How to run python files (.py) on the server; Don't limit it to Jupyter notebooks
* "You're wrong. This workshop was perfect."


*Did this workshop result in any new potential collaborations (i.e. people who you might contact in future to discuss research and/or professional issues)?*

* 5 responses: No the workshop did not result in any new potential collaborations
* 3 responses: I am not sure if the workshop resulted in any new potential collaborations
* 1 response: Yes, the workshop resulted in a lot (more than 5) potential collaborations

*If the workshops resulted in any new potential collaborations, are any of them with people outside your "home" discipline (i.e. your department)?*

* 6 responses: No.
* 3 responses: I don't know

*Do you have any ideas for new workshops that would help you with your research and professional development? If so, please briefly describe. If not, please write ("No ideas at the moment.")*

* Natural Language Processing workshop?
* Walkthrough of creating our own personal portfolio.
* A workshop on R or ArcGIS would be helpful.
* Remote debugging of python files running on mana

## Instructor Assessment Comments

*For your workshop, how would you rate the overall "success" of the workshop (i.e. your subjective sense of things like student engagement, questions, discussion, completion of activities, etc.)?*

* 1 response: About as successful as expected.
* 1 response: More successful than expected.
* 1 response: Very successful


*What aspects of your workshop did not work as well as possible, and what are your thoughts on how to improve them in future?*

* I think future workshops can skip over discussion sections.
* Being split virtually and in-person was difficult to make things collaborative for people to work together on exercises. I couldn't be with everyone all at once if people got stuck. So, I walked through them with the group all together. To improve this maybe being all in-person or all online would help and adjusting the HPC exercises to be more collaborative.
* Trying to get people to work together. The workshop was not originally designed with team work in mind as the exercises generally provide the exact solution and is performed in the users individual account on mana. If we were to try and improve this, you would probably need to make the exercises harder and setup would be required to allow users to work in a collaborative space on Mana.

*What aspects of your workshop do you feel worked well (so that we know to encourage their use in future workshops when appropriate)?*

* Great exercises
* I think walking through tutorials with everyone instead of only reading information word for word was a helpful way for people to practice using Mana resources and the steps it takes to do so. I'm curious to learn what people got out of it as a participant.
* I think overall, the hand off and presentation of the material and walking through the activities went well. I also feel that the stopping to help people that ran into problems went well as could be expected and went smoothly when encountered

*Is there anything else you would like us to know about your workshop? Are there ways we can better support your instruction in future?*

* I really appreciated working with David each week on this workshop and using the previous year's materials. It was very helpful and I learned about how to give a workshop and how to use the Morea framework through this experience.
* The ability to get feedback from those in the room is difficult from the remote perspective. In the software carpentry workshops use of post-its (colored) were used when all was in person, and fully remote users could just use an emoji, like thumbs up.
* With a hybrid, if in person users were also on zoom or if the view of the room allowed for us to actually see a person raising their hand etc, it might be a better experience.

## Discussion and recommendations

The initial questions assess several of the learning outcomes.  The responses provide evidence that the learning outcomes assessed were, in general, achieved. Participant feedback seems to indicate that the pacing of this workshop was pretty good.  Congrats to the instructors for learning from the first two workshop outcomes and adjusting their presentation accordingly! 

Recommendations for next time:

1. There were comments from both instructors and participants regarding the "discussion" sections not being that effective. For next time, consider improving the "prompts" for discussions, or else eliminate them. 
2. Consider having some (simple) exercises where the answer is not given within the materials. Have participants split up into small groups to try to solve them.  
3. The hybrid format is challenging. We need to figure out better ways to engage remote participants. 
4. Consider creating a final 5 minute "What's next?" section just prior to the assessment.  This is intended for independent "post-workshop" work by participants, not for coverage during the workshop.
