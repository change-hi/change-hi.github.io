## Preparation 

Here are the things you need to do to be prepared for this workshop.

### Have command line experience

We recommend you go through the [Software Carpentry shell-novice tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) if you are new to the command-line.  But, if you attended last week's workshop, you should be good to go with the command line!

### Install a modern web browser

We recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).  Internet Explorer is not recommended.

### Download the workshop Jupyter notebook

Please download [participants-copy-2022.ipynb](code/participants-copy-2022.ipynb) to your local computer (use "save as", i.e. right click).
