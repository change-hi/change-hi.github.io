## Preparation 

Today we will be using Mana so you will require an account in order to run the Jupyter notebooks.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-user-pen fa-xl"></i>  **Login to Mana**
<hr/>

Make sure you have access to Mana. You can test this by running:

```ssh
ssh username@uhhpc.its.hawaii.edu
```

or by going to uhhpc.its.hawaii.edu in a web browser and verifying you are able to login using your UH credentials.

We will be using a Jetstream virtual machine as a system for Tapis to send and pull files from.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" markdown="1">

<hr/>

You will recieve account credentials and the VM address from the instructors. You can make sure you are able to access the system by running attempting to ssh to it.
