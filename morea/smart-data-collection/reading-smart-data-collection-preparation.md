## Preparation 

Today we will be using Mana so you will require an account in order to run the Jupyter notebooks.

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" markdown="1">

<hr/>

Make sure you have access to Mana. You can test this by running:

```ssh
ssh username@uhhpc.its.hawaii.edu
```

or by going to uhhpc.its.hawaii.edu in a web browser and verifying you are able to login using your UH credentials.

We will be using a Jetstream virtual machine as a system for Tapis to send and pull files from.

You will recieve account credentials and the VM address from the instructors. You can make sure you are able to access the system by running attempting to ssh to it.
