<h1 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h1>
<p>This workshop will cover the fundamentals of descriptive models and methods for exploring characteristics of time series. Attendees will learn how to decompose and analyze a time seriesâ€™ secular trend, seasonal, cyclical, and irregular variability components; create descriptive additive/multiplicative models of time series; and explore characteristics of stationarity, autocorrelation, and cross-correlation with other time series. The workshop aims to investigate the practical application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using NOAA/GML climate change data, including factors like Annual Surface Temperature Change, CO2 concentration, and the frequency of climate-related disasters. The session will involve hands-on EDA using the R programming language.</p>
