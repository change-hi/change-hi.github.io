## Data Science, Big Displays and Interactive AI (Chris North)

### Abstract  

I’m a Visiting Researcher at UH Manoa (HI-DSI and Lava) while on sabbatical from Virginia Tech during the Spring semester, and looking forward to getting to know you all.  First, I will give an overview of some of the Data Science education initiatives at Virginia Tech, including the new Computational Modeling and Data Analytics degree program, which may help serve as an example for HI-DSI efforts.  Second, I will overview our research results on evaluating the utility and usability of large high-resolution display systems for data visualization, as well as some of the novel methods we have been developing for enabling usability for interactive AI and addressing the “two black boxes” problem of sensemaking.  Third, I will discuss some future agendas on which we can collaborate.
