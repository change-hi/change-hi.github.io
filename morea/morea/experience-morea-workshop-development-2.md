# 5. Workshop Development, Part 2

You have 25 minutes to work either alone or in a group to create an actual workshop on how to prepare the Best Recipe Ever. 

Here are the steps.

## Decide the Best Recipe Ever

You or your group must first decide what is, in fact, The Best Recipe Ever.

Definitely spend a few minutes arguing about this topic, because it's fun. There can be legitimate differences of opinion!  But come to some sort of decision fairly quickly so you have time to actually document the recipe.

If you don't cook, then think up a dish that you love at a restaurant, and then google for a recipe for that dish. That's close enough for today.

## Edit the Ice Breaker

Every (good) workshop begins with an Ice Breaker: a way for folks to get to know each other.  

Edit the experience-best-recipe-ever-ice-breaker.md file with your idea for an ice breaker. 

When you've edited the file, click the mouse to make the Terminal pane active, then type `control-c control-p return`.  This stops the running process, and restarts it to rebuild the site. 

Now refresh the window displaying the site in your browser and you should see your changes. 

## Edit the shopping page

Now edit the experience-best-recipe-ever-shopping.md file to document what needs to be bought and where it can be bought in order to prepare the Best Recipe Ever.

It would be good to have an itemized list.  Maybe a picture or two? 

## Edit the preparation page

Finally, edit the experience-best-recipe-ever-preparation.md file to document how the dish must be prepared. 

Itemized lists, pictures, admonitions, etc are all good to include.

## Pro tips

<div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-globe fa-xl"></i> **How do I format text? Add images?**
<hr/>

You write text in a format called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). If you don't want to spend time reading documentation, then there's a pretty easy alternative: just search through other workshops for the kind of formatting you want, and then look at the corresponding file in your browser to see how that workshop author did it!

The [Morea Framework Reference Guide](https://morea-framework.github.io/docs/category/reference) provides more detailed information if you want to do something but can't find someone else who already did it.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info fa-xl"></i> **Oh no! I broke the site!**
<hr/>

If all goes according to plan, you will mess up and get an error when you invoke `bundle exec jekyll serve` to rebuild the site. Don't worry, it happens to all of us. 

Spend a couple of minutes seeing if you can figure out what went wrong. If you don't understand, raise your hand and someone will help you.
