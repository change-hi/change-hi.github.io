# Metadata
This section will describe what metadata is.

## What is (or are) metadata?

Simply put, metadata is data about the data. Sound confusing? Lets clarify: metadata is the _description of data_. It allows deeper understanding of data and provides insight for its interpretation. Hence, your metadata should be considered as important as your data. Further, metadata plays a very important role in making your data FAIR. It should be continuously added to your research data (not just at the beginning or end of a project!). Metadata can be produced in an automated way (e.g. when you capture a microscopy image usually the accompanying software saves metadata as part of it) or manually.

<ins>Let's take a look at an example:</ins>

This is a confocal microscopy image of a _C. elegans_ nematode strain used
as a proteostasis model (Pretty! Isn't it?). The image is part of the raw data
associated to [Goya et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.12.078),
which was deposited in a Public Omero Server  
[Project](https://publicomero.bio.ed.ac.uk/webclient/?show=project-58)  
[Figure1 set](https://publicomero.bio.ed.ac.uk/webclient/?show=dataset-231)

.
What information **can you get** from the image, without the associated description (metadata)?

Let's see the associated metadata of the image and the dataset to which it belongs:

## Image metadata

## Dataset metadata

Name: Figure2_Figure2B
Dataset ID: 263
Owner: Maria Eugenia Goya
ORCID: 0000-0002-5031-2470

Description:
The datasets contains a time course of α-syn aggregation in NL5901 C.
elegans worms after a food switch at the L4 stage:

E. coli OP50 to OP50
Day 01 adults
Day 03 adults
Day 05 adults
Day 07 adults
Day 10 adults
Day 13 adults

E. coli OP50 to B. subtilis PXN21
Day 01 adults
Day 03 adults
Day 05 adults
Day 07 adults
Day 10 adults
Day 13 adults

Images were taken at 6 developmental timepoints (D1Ad, D3Ad, D5Ad,
D7Ad, D10Ad, D13Ad)

\* Some images contain more than one nematode.

Each image contains ~30 (or more) Z-sections, 1 µmeters apart. The
TagYFP channel is used to follow the alpha-synuclein particles. The TL
DIC channel is used to image the whole nematode head.

These images were used to construct Figure 2B of the Cell Reports
paper (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.12.078>).

This is a lot of information!

## Types of metadata

According to [How to FAIR](https://howtofair.dk/) we can distinguish
between three main types of metadata:

- **Administrative metadata:** data about a project or resource
  that are relevant for managing it; E.g. project/resource owner,
  principal investigator, project collaborators, funder, project period,
  etc. They are usually assigned to the data, before you collect or create
  them.
- **Descriptive or citation metadata:** data about a dataset or
  resource that allow people to discover and identify it; E.g.
  authors, title, abstract, keywords, persistent identifier, related
  publications, etc.
- **Structural metadata:** data about how a dataset or resource
  came about, but also how it is internally structured. E.g. the unit
  of analysis, collection method, sampling procedure, sample size,
  categories, variables, etc. Structural metadata have to be gathered by
  the researchers according to best practice in their research community
  and will be published together with the data.

Descriptive and structural **metadata should be added
continuously** throughout the project.

## Identifying metadata

<hr/>

Here we have an excel spreadsheet that contains project metadata for
a made-up experiment of plant metabolites

In groups, identify different types of metadata (administrative,
descriptive, structural) present in this example.

<li>Descriptive metadata marked in orange</li>

</ul>

## Where does data end and metadata start?

What is "data" and what is "metadata" can be a matter of
perspective: Some researchers' metadata can be other researchers'
data.

For example, a funding body is categorised as typical administrative metadata,
however, it can be used to calculate numbers of public datasets per funder
and then used to compare effects of different funders' policies on open practices.



## Adding metadata to your experiments

Good metadata are crucial for assuring re-usability of your outcomes.
Adding metadata is also a very time-consuming process if done manually,
so collecting metadata should be done incrementally during your experiment.

As we saw metadata can take many forms
from as simple as including a ReadMe.txt file,
by embedding them inside the Excel files,
to using domain specific metadata standards and formats.

But,

- **What should be included in metadata?**
- **What terms should be used in descriptions?**

For many assay methods and experiment types, there are defined recommendations
and guidelines called **Minimal Information Standards**.

## Minimal Information Standard

The minimum information standard is a set of guidelines for reporting data
derived by relevant methods in biosciences.
If followed, it ensures that the data can be easily verified,
analysed and clearly interpreted by the wider scientific community.
Keeping with these recommendations also facilitates the foundation of structuralized
databases, public repositories and development of data analysis tools.
Individual minimum information standards are brought by the communities of cross-disciplinary
specialists focused on issues of the specific method used in experimental biology.

Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations [(MIBBI)](https://fairsharing.org/collection/MIBBI)
is the collection of the most known standards.

[FAIRSharing](https://fairsharing.org/standards/) offers excellent search service
for finding standards

<i class="fa-solid fa-user-pen fa-xl"></i>  **Exercise: Minimum information**
<hr/>

Look at **_Minimum Information about a Neuroscience Investigation (MINI) Electrophysiology_** [Gibson, F. et al. Nat Prec (2008)](https://www.nature.com/articles/npre.2008.1720.1.pdf).
which contains recommendations for reporting the use of electrophysiology in a neuroscience study.  
(_Neuroscience (or neurobiology) is the scientific study of the nervous system_).

Scroll to _Reporting requirement_ and decide which of the points 1-8 are:
* important for understanding and reuse of data
* important for technical replication
* could be applied to other experiments in neuroscience

<p>
What if there are no metadata standards defined for your data / field of research?
</p>

<p>
Think about the minimum information that someone else (from your lab or from any
other lab in the world) would need to know to be able to work with your dataset
without any further input from you.
</p>
Think as a consumer of your data not the producer!

## What to include? 

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-user-pen fa-xl"></i>  **Exercise: Sharing data**
<hr/>

Think of the data you generate in your projects,and imagine you are going to share them.

What information would another researcher need to understand or reproduce your data (the structural metadata)?

For example, we believe that any dataset should have:
- a name/title
- its purpose or experimental hypothesis

Write down and compare your proposals, can we find some common elements?

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

Some typical elements are:
<ul>
<li>Biological material, e.g. Species, Genotypes, Tissue type, Age, Health conditions</li>
<li>Biological context, e.g. speciment growth, entrainment, samples preparation</li>
<li>Experimental factors and conditions, e.g. drug treatments, stress factors</li>
<li>Primers, plasmid sequences, cell line information, plasmid construction</li>
<li>Specifics of data acquisition</li>
<li>Specifics of data processing and analysis</li>
<li>Definition of variables</li>
<li>Accompanying code, software used (version nr), parameters applied, statistical tests used, seed for randomisation</li>
<li>LOT numbers</li>
</ul>
</details>
</div>


## Metadata and FAIR guidelines

Metadata provides extremely valuable information for us and others to be able to
interpret, process, reuse and reproduce the research data it accompanies.

Because metadata are data about data, all of the FAIR principles i.e.
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable apply to metadata.

Ideally, metadata should not only be machine-readable, but also interoperable
so that they can interlink or be reasoned about by computer systems.
