# Intellectual Property, Licensing, and Openness

Intellectual property (IP) is something that you create using your
mind - for example, a story, an invention, an artistic work
or a symbol.

The timeline of "opening" matters when one seeks legal protection
for their IP.

For example, patents are granted only for inventions that are
**new and were not known to the public** in any form.
Publishing in a journal or presenting in a conference
information related to the invention completely
**prevents the inventor from getting a patent**!

You can benefit from new collaborations, industrial partnerships, and consultations which are acquired by openness.
This can yield greater benefit than from patent-related royalties.


## (Optional) Intellectual property protection

You can use a patent to protect a non-obvious (_technical_)
invention that provides "technical contribution" or solves a "technical problem".
It gives you the right to take legal action against anyone who
makes, uses, sells or imports it without your permission.

In principle, software can be patented.
It is usually, settled by the court for each case.

**Software code is copyrighted**. Copyright prevents people from:

- copying your code
- distributing copies of it, whether free of charge or for sale.

Data cannot be patented, and in principle, it cannot be copyrighted.
**It is not possible to copyright facts!**

Facts are not patentable, and since machine learning algorithms
like neural networks are basically mathematical methods, they
are exempt from protection. However, applied to a certain
problem, an algorithm may become part of a patent. _IF framed it in
the right way, patenting an algorithm is possible.
For example, a deep learning algorithm generating a certain kind of
audio may be eligible. But that would not prevent the network from
being applied to any other problem._

However, how data are collated and presented
(especially if it is a database),
can have a layer of copyright protection.
Deciding what data needs to be included in a database,
how to organize the data, and how to relate different data elements are all creative
decisions that may receive copyright protection.
Again, it is often a case by case situation and may come down to who has
better lawyers.

## Checking common licenses

<hr/>

1. Open CC BY license summary [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
   is it clear how you can use the data under this licence and why it is popular in academia?

2. Check the MIT license wording: [https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
   is it clear what you can do with software code under this licence?

3. Compare the full wording of CC BY
   [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)
   can you guess why the MIT licence is currently the most popular for open source code?

 Possible benefits and consequences for each part:

<ol>
<li>CC BY license states material can be reproduced, shared, in whole or in part, unless where exceptions and limitations are stated. Attributions must be made to the Licensor.</li>
<li>MIT license states that Software can by used without restriction (to copy, modify, publish, distribute etc...)</li>
<li>The MIT license is short, to the point and optimised for software developers as it offers flexibility.</li>
