# E15: Try Git

(Try Git is apparently no longer in existence.)

[Try Git](https://try.github.io/) is an interactive site that gets you comfortable with basic git commands. 

For this experience, go through the tutorial.  When it asks you to create a free Code School account in order to earn a badge, please do so. 

When you have finished this tutorial, you will be awarded a badge. Go to your profile page on Code School and click the "Make Public" link.  Once you've done that, your profile link can be viewed by anyone and will display your Try Git badge.  For example, here is my public profile at [https://www.codeschool.com/users/philipmjohnson](https://www.codeschool.com/users/philipmjohnson). (Scroll to the bottom of the page to see my Try Git badge.)

## Submission instructions

Due by the time and date indicated on the Schedule page, finish this tutorial and make your profile page public so that your Try Git badge is publicly accessible.

Then, submit your assignment via Laulima.  It should contain:

  * A full link to your Code School public profile page showing your Try Git badge that verifies completion of this tutorial.
