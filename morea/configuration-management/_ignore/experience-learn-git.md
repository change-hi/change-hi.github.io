# Experience Learn Git with CodeAcademy

Go through the two hour [CodeAcademy Learn Git course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) to become familiar with Git.

## Submission instructions

Since this is optional, you do not have to submit anything. However, I recommend you play around with at least one of these sites to become more comfortable with git.
