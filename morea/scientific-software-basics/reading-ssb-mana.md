{% include figure.html url="" max-width="100%" file="/morea/scientific-software-basics/fig/select_desktop.png" alt="Node anatomy" caption="" %}

Your input values should be:

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="100%" file="/morea/scientific-software-basics/fig/check_ignition.png" alt="Node anatomy" caption="" %}

The output should look like this:

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="100%" file="/morea/scientific-software-basics/fig/waiting_for_a_session.png" alt="Node anatomy" caption="" %}

{% include figure.html url="" max-width="100%" file="/morea/scientific-software-basics/fig/my_interactive_session.png" alt="Node anatomy" caption="" %}

## Download sample files for this workshop

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-user-pen fa-xl"></i>  **Download data-shell.zip**
<hr/>

1. Right click on [data-shell.zip](/morea/scientific-software-basics/data/data-shell.zip) and select "Save as..." to download this zip file to your computer.

2. Bring up a Terminal window (MacOS) or Command shell (Windows), find the data-shell.zip file, and run `unzip data-shell.zip` to create a folder called `data-shell` with several files and directories in it that will be used in this workshop. In MacOS (at least), you can just double-click the data-shell.zip file within the Finder to invoke the unzip command on it.
