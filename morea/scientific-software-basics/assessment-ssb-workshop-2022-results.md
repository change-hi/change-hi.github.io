# Scientific Software Basics Workshop 2022 Assessment Results

## Participant Assessment Comments

*In your own words, what does the "pwd" command do? (If you don't remember, just write "I don't remember."*

* displays the current directory
* This command passes the current working directory.
* print working directory
* print work directory
* print working directory
* print working directory
* pwd means print working directory or the path to the current folder you are in
* shows the directory you are currently on.
* print working directory
* "print working directory" it prints the directory you are in
* print working directory

*In your own words, what does the pipe command do? (If you don't remember, just write "I don't remember").* 

* It passes the output of one command as an input into another one
* it designates another command to run on the command left of the pipe
* Returns the number of lines per file.
* output the contents of one command to another
* put the previous output to second input
* I don't remember
* channel the output of one command into the input of another
* The pipe takes the output of the command on the left and puts it into the command on the right side of the bar
* takes result of the command before as an input to the command after
* loops from the previous command
* It takes the output of one command and sends it as input to another command
* takes output from one command and passes it as input to another


*In your own words, what is the difference between "find" and "grep"? (If you don't remember, just write "I don't remember")* 

* We were not able to reach this within the workshop, but find allows you to do simple searches of files and directories, where grep allows you to find content within directories.
* we didn't get to this in the workshop
* I don't remember
* search for a searchterm from an output
* I don't remember
* grep is used to search for patterns in files/filenames,
* I don't remember
* I don't think we got to this module, but find and grep allows you to look for words or strings in a file.
* I don't remember
* Find locates file in a given directory? Don't know what "grep" is
* We did not cover these in the workshop
* find returns files in directory; grep is used to search for pattern in the files' content


*In general, did you find the CONTENT of this workshop to be useful?  If so, please briefly summarize up to three skills you acquired (or started to acquire) as a result of this workshop.  If not, please write "Content not useful."*

* Yes; I was reminded of how to use loops in shell scripts to easily iterate over a lot of content, and how to properly name shell variables for usage in scripts.
* Very useful, I didn't know loops could be performed in the command line, I'd never used pipes, or output commands to a .txt file
* The content of the workshop was useful. Skills acquired: connecting to mana, creating a working directory, and moving files in mana.
* It was great. I already know how to use type commands on a CLI but it was nice to get a refresher. I learned how to launch a jupyter lab from the mana website. cat is short for concatenate.
* I think yes. I learned about basic command line skills for sorting and analyzing data.
* yes very useful. navigating cormfortably in the command line, using loops, and moving/copying/renaming files
* Some of the content could be useful for a review, or useful to those who don't have command line experience.
* Yes, I think these modules are a great resource for navigating the command line and executing Linux commands. Having a better understanding of "wc", pipes, and loops were helpful for me
* It is useful to make me more comfortable to work with shell commands
* The content was useful and is applicable to domain science.
* I did find the content useful. I refreshed my knoweldge of basic linux commands, gained practice with command line loops, and saw how to log into MANA for the first time.
* I have prior experience with using shell commands, but it was a good refresher.

*In general, did you find the PEDAGOGY (i.e. method of teaching) of this workshop to be appropriate?  If so, please briefly summarize one or two teaching methods you found to be useful. If not, please write "Pedagogy was not appropriate."*

* Yes, the dual use of the content on the website plus the explanations helped with understanding of material.
* Yes, it was great. Running through the commands and exercises with the terminal open allowed hands-on practice, and the instructors clarified what these commands meant and why they operate the way they do.
* Following along with the presentation in mana was very useful. I also found the frequent exercises very helpful in monitoring my understanding of the commands.
* Yes, will did a great job teaching. He went through each of the exercises and read out each paragraph for me word by word. It was easy to follow.
* Yes, mostly appropriate.
* yes i thought it was generally very good. i know there's not much time, but a little more interactive learning would have been really nice as well
* Pedagogy was not appropriate
* Yes, I think defining the commands and going through examples of how they work were helpful.
* Yes, but workshop was too fast to be hands-on.
* This workshop attempts to cover a lot of material over a relatively short span of time. Regular check-ins with participants to ensure they are following along would be very helpful.
* I liked the inclusion of "in-line" exercises. This lets everyone think about the content live with the presentation.
* Since I had experience with using the shell commands, the PEDAGOGY of this specific workshop was not that beneficial. However, it would have been useful for novices.

*No workshop is perfect. What are one or two things you would suggest we change to improve this workshop in future?  If you can't think of anything, then write "You're wrong. This workshop was perfect."*

* I would suggest exercises that are beyond just reading from the site, it would be good if there was more interaction.  I understand the workshops are pressed for time.
* Maybe slow down a bit if the audience in inexperienced, but we were a bit behind so this pace was understandable.
* The pre-workshop materials could be improved (clearer instructions on accessing mana and downloading the files so that everyone is ready to go at the start of the workshop.) This would also help get through all of the material in time.
* I would suggest running poll for answering the exercises. Some additional advanced exercises would be nice too.
* It would be better to offer a list of terminology with examples.
* doing 1-2 exercises together everything - maybe even have someone share a screen. i find it helpful to 'debug' together if something is stuck
* Did not spend enough time for people to actually follow along through the workshop. Did not check if people were keeping up at each stage, and did not let people try to answer the questions. If it had been at a slow pace to follow along, there would've been way too much content to fit into the allotted time (which is likely why you guys rushed through, but that defeats the purpose). This wasn't formatted in a way that is very beneficial to people who are already familiar with the command line, but attendance isn't optional.
* This workshop was great! I appreciated the organization of the content and what was presented. It was a little dense at times with examples, reading the modules word for word, and we didn't get through all the topics, but I like that the resource will always be there to go back to.
* Reduce the pace and make it hands-on
* The workshop assumes a prior understanding of this interface. A troubleshooting guide to commonly encountered errors/ difficulties could be included.
* After participating in two of these workshops delivered through Morea modules, I have to mention that I think the workshops could be structured much better. In my opinion, the modules contain too much information to be realistically covered in the time allotted. Also, having a wall of text on the board seems a little overwhelming for attendees. I think that shorter presentations not directly presenting the modules could be more useful (more like a presentation of the module material instead of presenting the module itself). Then attendees could access the modules on their own after seeing the presentations.
* The start of the session was not that smooth. It felt like the presenters were "winging it" :)

*Did this workshop result in any new potential collaborations (i.e. people who you might contact in future to discuss research and/or professional issues)?*

* 6 responses: I am not sure if the workshop resulted in
any new potential collaborations
* 5 responses: No, the workshop did not result in any
  new potential collaborations.
* 1 response: Yes, the workshop resulted in a handful
(less than 5) potential collaborations

*If the workshops resulted in any new potential collaborations, are any of them with people outside your "home" discipline (i.e. your department)?*

* 5 response: No, any potential collaborations are with people from my home discipline (or, the  workshops did not result in any potential collaborations).
* 1 responses: Yes, at least one is outside
* 5 responses: I don't know

*Is there anything else you would like us to know about this workshop?*

* The CLI is terribly complex, and I think this is a great overview of the topic!
* Nope, I got a lot out of it, thank you!
* no
* Thanks for hosting it!!

## Instructor Assessment Comments

*For your workshop, how would you rate the overall "success" of the workshop (i.e. your subjective sense of things like student engagement, questions, discussion, completion of activities, etc.)?*

* 2 responses: About as successful as expected.

*What aspects of your workshop did not work as well as possible, and what are your thoughts on how to improve them in future?*

* We had a lot of content to cover so it was hard to stay on track. I think it would be more beneficial to provide a list of exercises to do with workshop leaders available to provide assistance.
* More time to coordinate with the other presenter might have allow us to get through more of the material.

*What aspects of your workshop do you feel worked well (so that we know to encourage their use in future workshops when appropriate)?*

* I think the exercises within the module were very effective at having people put the knowledge they learned into practice.
* I thought switch presenter section by section worked for this material, but confirmation bias could be at work.

*Is there anything else you would like us to know about your workshop? Are there ways we can better support your instruction in future?*

* I spent all of my time on this workshop getting the content into Morea without being able to look at the content we were presenting. I hope the next presenter has more time to look at the content rather than reformatting the whole time.
* Trimming the content to Shell only was spot on. The only minor hiccup was the timing of posting the setup instructions as a prereq rather than part of the presentation, but posting the disclaimer worked.

## Discussion and recommendations

The initial questions assess several of the learning outcomes.  The responses provide evidence that not all of the learning outcomes assessed were achieved due to time constraints. Like the first workshop, participants felt that this workshop appeared to be rushed, and there was little evidence that participants made connections across disciplines. 

Recommendations for next time:

1. Debug the pre-workshop instructions to make sure they are accurate, and have participants do that work in advance to free up more time during the workshop.
1. Review Fall 2022 screencast to determine which sections were "rushed", and reduce content in those sections.
3. Provide group work opportunities during exercises.
4. Increase ways to increase ability of participants to learn about each other's disciplines and form interdisciplinary connections.  Could be through an initial ice-breaker exercise or integrated into small group exercises.
5. Create a final 5 minute "What's next?" section just prior to the assessment. This section provides links to more advanced material and/or material removed from the "rushed" sections. This is intended for independent "post-workshop" work by participants, not for coverage during the workshop.
