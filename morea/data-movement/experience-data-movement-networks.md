# 2. Networks

<div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-globe fa-xl"></i> **Overview**
<hr/>
  
**Questions**
* What do networks look like?
* What does the equipment that connects everything look like?  
 
**Objectives**
* Understand the topology of scientific networks.
* Have an idea of what some of the technology underlying networks looks like.

## Hardware

### Medium scale Juniper router

This router is capable of supporting 10Gbps and 100Gbps interfaces for long distance links:

### Infrared laser

The infrared laser that transmits over the fiber is visible in the upper connector. The light is visible to my phone camera, but not to the naked eye.
