<hr/>
  
**Questions**
* What do networks look like?
* What does the equipment that connects everything look like?  
 
**Objectives**

## Hardware

### Medium scale Juniper router

This router is capable of supporting 10Gbps and 100Gbps interfaces for long distance links:

### Infrared laser

The infrared laser that transmits over the fiber is visible in the upper connector. The light is visible to my phone camera, but not to the naked eye.
