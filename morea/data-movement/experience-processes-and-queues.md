# 4. Processes and Queues

<div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert" markdown="1">
<i class="fa-solid fa-globe fa-xl"></i> **Overview**
<hr/>
 
**Questions**
* What are Queues/Buffers?
* How does data actually move from machine to machine?

**Objectives**
* Understand the processes involved in transfering data from one machine to another.  

</div>

## Queues (also known as buffers)

Queues are places where things arrive to wait for something

Data waits in queues for a chance to be transmitted further

Queues are the reason that everything in the universe isn't stuck waiting for everything else.

### File transfer

Now let's add buffering:

<i class="fa-solid fa-globe fa-xl"></i> **Key Points**
<hr/>

* Data moves by processes:
    * Enqueuing data
    * Dequeuing data
* Some Network queues have "easy" adjustments because:
    * Of large variation in latency
    * Optimizations vary by use-case
* Storage systems benefit from design choices
* Most defaults support many users sharing a resource* 
* Our use case is more about committing entire machines to a single purpose
* There are many processes in transfering data that can cause bottlenecks and degrade performance, the network is only one of many of these processes.
